# AdjointPAT

## Description
Numerical experiments of the adjoint PAT methods with under-sampled sensors. The behaviors of Time-Reversal (TR), Back-Projection (BP), and Truncated Back-Projection (TBP) reconstruction are demonstrated.

The demo is coded by Matlab with the auxiliary of the k-Wave toolbox. GPU is also required to accelerate the running time.

## User guide
Run "demo/Demo_PointSrc.m" and "demo/Demo2_OA-Breast_reconstruction.m" to see the reconstructed images by using TR, BP, and TBP. The results are restored in the directory of "output".
